Android sensoring app

----------------------------------------------------------------------

##About
Recent cellphones offer lots of sensors. Since most robotics teams will have at
least one member with a smartphone, they can be a cheap and efficient solution
to sensoring. This is the Android application we are using to send sensor data
to our Trekking/Magellan robot.

This is an initial commit, a lot has to be done yet.

##Features
-GPS

-Orientation (either TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR, TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR or TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD)

-Torch (flash)
More features can be added easily.

##TODO
This initial commit has a lot of TODOs. We have a competition in less than a month
and are rushing, so these changes will take some time to be done:
1. Translate code to English

2. Generate Doxygen documentation

3. Move from the deprecated Camera API to Camera2

4. Add instructions to communicate with this app

5. Add licence information to source files
